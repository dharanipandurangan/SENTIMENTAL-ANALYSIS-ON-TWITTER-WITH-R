### TWITTER

  Twitter is a micro-blogging platform where users can post their messages as tweets and read others messages or tweets on a single page in reverse chronology or timeline. By default, all tweets are publicly visible unless users tweak their privacy settings. Because of constraints on the length of tweets, Twitter follows a few conventions to enable its users to add a structure to their tweets. For example, the @symbol is used to refer to other users in tweets and the #symbol is used to categorize tweets.
